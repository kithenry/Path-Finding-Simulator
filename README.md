# Path-Finding-Simulator

### Progress Log
#### Day One (29/03/2025)
- Setup Working Environment
  - Installed pygame
  - Confirmed g++ was working 
- Drew a red square on a pygame window ![Screenshot From 2025-03-29 11-35-12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/345d3c73-e53b-40e1-b179-3c7b78743a48)
- Refresher on C++ arrays
- Resources
- [PygameTut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWpgLFMI7w&t=1962s)
- [Pygame Docs](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/draw.html#pygame.draw.rect)
- [C++ Array Refresher](https://youtu.be/Vh4krbTnTAA?si=IZ6TX1RZA5S7lh_W)
- Setup git repo for project

### Day Two
- Reading up on A* search
    - Did some revision on underlying algorithms: DFS, BFS
    - Read up on heuristic algorithms and those that combine both cost and heuristic (the A* search)
    - Wrote the pseudo code for the A* search algorithm in C++
    - Came to the realisation how much revision I need.
    - Stretched time duration till I hit my goal

#### Tentative plan
- Week One :    Sorting algorithms, time complexity and space complexity analysis
- Week Two: The Equivalence Problem; Maze generator using Union
- Week Three: Graph Algorithms; CLI Path finding using DFS
